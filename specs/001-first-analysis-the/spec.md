# Feature Specification: Bank Account Statement Visualizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-first-analysis-the`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "First analysis the existing project and understand the code base structure and features  Now we need to implement a new feature as"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the expense tracking application, I want to upload my bank account statement file so that I can visualize my transactions, apply filters, search through them, and easily add selected transactions to my existing expense tracking flow with proper categorization and comments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into the application, **When** I navigate to the bank statement upload page, **Then** I should see a file upload interface that accepts CSV/TXT files
2. **Given** I have uploaded a valid bank statement file, **When** the file is processed, **Then** I should see a table/list of all transactions with columns for date, narration, debit amount, credit amount, and balance
3. **Given** I can see the uploaded transactions, **When** I apply date range filters, **Then** I should see only transactions within the selected date range
4. **Given** I can see the uploaded transactions, **When** I search for specific text in transaction narrations, **Then** I should see only matching transactions
5. **Given** I can see the uploaded transactions, **When** I click on a narration field, **Then** I should be able to edit the narration text inline
6. **Given** I can see filtered transactions, **When** I select one or more transactions, **Then** I should be able to add them to my existing expense tracking with type selection (income/expense/investment) and comments
7. **Given** I have uploaded transactions, **When** I view the visualization section, **Then** I should see charts showing expense, income, and other transaction types with interactive filtering
8. **Given** I can see the charts, **When** I apply date range or transaction type filters, **Then** the charts should update to reflect the filtered data
9. **Given** I have added transactions to my expense tracking, **When** I view my dashboard, **Then** I should see these transactions integrated with my existing data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I upload an invalid file format? (Only CSV and TXT files are supported)
- What happens when the uploaded file has malformed data or missing columns?
- What happens when I try to add the same transaction multiple times?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload bank statement files in CSV and TXT formats only
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse uploaded files and extract transaction data (date, narration, debit amount, credit amount, balance)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display uploaded transactions in a searchable and filterable table format
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide date range filtering for uploaded transactions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide text search functionality for transaction narrations
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to edit narration text inline by clicking on narration fields
- **FR-016**: System MUST save edited narration text and update the display immediately
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to select individual or multiple transactions
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to categorize selected transactions as income, expense, investment, or debt
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to add comments/notes to selected transactions
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate selected transactions into the existing expense tracking system
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual feedback during file upload and processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle file upload errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages
- **FR-012**: System MUST display charts for easy visualization of expense, income, and other transaction types from uploaded statements
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to filter charts by date range and transaction type
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide interactive charts that update when filters are applied

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bank Statement**: Represents an uploaded file containing transaction data, with attributes like filename, upload date, and processing status
- **Transaction**: Represents individual transaction entries from bank statements, with attributes like date, narration, debit amount, credit amount, balance, and source statement
- **Statement Upload Session**: Represents a user's current upload and selection session, tracking which transactions are selected for import
