# Quickstart: Bank Statement UI Fixes

**Feature**: Bank Statement UI Fixes  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Phase**: 1 - Design & Contracts

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Theme Consistency Verification

**Given** I navigate to the bank statement page  
**When** I view the page layout  
**Then** I should see a dark blue background matching the existing application theme

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/bank-statement` route
2. Verify page background is dark blue (`#152251`)
3. Verify text is white and readable
4. Verify cards have white backgrounds with shadows
5. Verify primary color (`#0ab377`) is used for buttons and accents

**Expected Result**: Bank statement page matches the visual theme of other application pages

### Scenario 2: Transaction Table Data Display

**Given** I have uploaded a bank statement file  
**When** I view the transaction table  
**Then** I should see all transaction data clearly displayed

**Steps**:
1. Upload a valid CSV/TXT bank statement file
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Verify transaction table shows:
   - Date in DD/MM/YYYY format
   - Complete narration text (not truncated)
   - Transaction type (Debit/Credit)
   - Amount with proper currency formatting
   - Balance information
   - Reference numbers
4. Verify data is properly aligned in columns
5. Verify pagination works correctly

**Expected Result**: All transaction data is visible and properly formatted in the table

### Scenario 3: Filter Alignment Fix

**Given** I can see the transaction filters section  
**When** I view the date range filters  
**Then** I should see properly aligned input fields

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to bank statement page with uploaded data
2. Locate the "Date Range" filter section
3. Verify "From" and "To" date inputs are:
   - Horizontally aligned
   - Same height and width
   - Properly spaced with "to" label between them
   - Using consistent styling with other filters
4. Verify filter inputs work correctly
5. Verify responsive behavior on mobile devices

**Expected Result**: Date range filters are properly aligned and functional

### Scenario 4: Chart Dark Theme Integration

**Given** I can see the transaction analysis charts  
**When** I view the charts on the dark background  
**Then** I should see charts with proper dark theme styling

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to bank statement page with uploaded data
2. Scroll to the "Transaction Analysis" section
3. Verify charts have:
   - White/light text for labels and legends
   - Light grid lines for visibility
   - High contrast colors for data series
   - Proper background transparency
4. Test different chart types (bar, line, pie)
5. Verify chart controls are readable and functional

**Expected Result**: Charts are clearly visible and readable on dark background

### Scenario 5: Component Styling Consistency

**Given** I can see all bank statement components  
**When** I compare them with existing application components  
**Then** I should see consistent styling patterns

**Steps**:
1. Navigate between bank statement page and dashboard
2. Compare styling of:
   - Cards and containers
   - Buttons and form elements
   - Input fields and dropdowns
   - Typography and spacing
3. Verify consistent use of:
   - Color scheme
   - Box shadows
   - Border radius
   - Padding and margins
4. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

**Expected Result**: Bank statement components match the styling of existing application components

### Scenario 6: Mobile Responsiveness

**Given** I access the bank statement page on a mobile device  
**When** I view all components  
**Then** I should see properly responsive layouts

**Steps**:
1. Open bank statement page on mobile device or narrow browser window
2. Verify:
   - Sidebar navigation is hidden appropriately
   - Components stack vertically when needed
   - Text remains readable at small sizes
   - Touch targets are appropriately sized
   - Filters adapt to single column layout
3. Test all interactive elements
4. Verify charts are still functional and readable

**Expected Result**: Bank statement page is fully functional and readable on mobile devices

### Scenario 7: Data Integration Flow

**Given** I have fixed UI components  
**When** I use the complete bank statement workflow  
**Then** I should have a seamless experience

**Steps**:
1. Upload bank statement file
2. Verify data displays correctly in table
3. Apply filters and verify they work
4. Edit transaction narrations inline
5. Select transactions for expense tracking
6. View charts and verify they update with filters
7. Test "Add to Expense Tracking" functionality
8. Verify all data persists during session

**Expected Result**: Complete bank statement workflow functions correctly with fixed UI
